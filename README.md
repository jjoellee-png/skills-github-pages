## Step 3: Customize your homepage

*Nice work setting the theme! ✨*

You can customize your homepage by adding content to either an `index.md` file or the `README.md` file. GitHub Pages first looks for an `index.md` file. Your repository has an `index.md` file so we can update it to include your personalized content.

### :keyboard: Activity: Create your homepage

1. Browse to the `index.md` file in the `my-pages` branch.
2. In the upper right corner, open the file editor.
3. Type the content you want on your homepage. You can use **Markdown formatting** on this page.
4. *(Optional)* You can also modify `title:` or just ignore it for now. We'll discuss it in the next step.
5. Commit your changes to the `my-pages` branch.
6. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically update to the next step.
